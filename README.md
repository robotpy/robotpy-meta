Let's say that you wanted to install the latest version of the NavX software
along with command based programming. You would do this:

On Windows:

```
py -3 -m pip install -U robotpy[navx,commands2]
```

On Linux/OSX:

```
pip3 install -U robotpy[navx,commands2]
```

There is a special 'all' category which will install the core components
and all of the optional categories.
